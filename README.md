# Content_Based_Image_Retrieval_using_Deep_Convolutional_Autoencoder
This project implements a deep convolutional autoencoder to perform content-based image retrieval (CBIR) on an animal image dataset. The model learns a compressed latent representation of the images, enabling efficient retrieval of similar images based on content rather than metadata or labels. The project demonstrates:

Preprocessing and loading an animal dataset

Building and training a convolutional autoencoder using TensorFlow/Keras

Extracting latent features for image retrieval

Using Euclidean distance in latent space to find similar images

Visualizing query images and top-k similar matches
